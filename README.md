The Puzzle of Life Beta
Conway's Game of Life as a strategy puzzle game

The goal of TPoL is to build patterns in Conway's Game of Life to destroy your opponent's base (kill any of their purple cells),
while occasionally defending your own.

Cells are different colours depending on their owner:
  Black - Dead
  Blue - Your's/Player's
  Red - Enemy's
  Orange - Debris
  Purple - Base

Controls:
  Left click to place a cell, right click to remove one (only works inside your build zone in singleplayer which is shaded lighter grey)
  Space turns time on or off. You can't manually edit the board while time is running - turn it off again to build more.
  Escape returns you to the previous menu.
  Clicking a pattern on the right selects it, left click anywhere on the board where it fits to place it down, or right click to clear it.
  Pressing 'r' rotates the pattern 90 degrees clockwise; pressing 't' flips it horizontally; pressing 'f' flips is vertically.
  Ctrl + 'z' undoes your most recent action.

Singleplayer contains a selection of prebuilt levels to play.
Level Editor allows you to build your own levels and save them to play later.
Level Editor Controls:
  Left click cycles through cell colours, right click cycles backwards.
  Space turns time on or off, however the board is returned to its original state when time is turned off.
  's' saves your current board as 'savedgrid.csv' in your main PvP Conway's directory (not /levels).
 Empty Level provides an empty, non-build-restricted space to test patterns in.
 
 conwaylife.com/wiki/ is a great resource for finding Conway's Game of Life patterns if you are unfamiliar with the game or want to learn some new ones.
